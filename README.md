# ScrollSnap

Scrollsnap is an addon-theme for BetterDiscord that snaps the scrollbar to messages, channels, users, guilds, and settings. ScrollSnap aims to create a better user experience for you. ScrollSnap can be used in combination with any other theme, as it does not alter the look/layout of any element.
